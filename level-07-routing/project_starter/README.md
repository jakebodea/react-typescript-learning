# Project Starter for Level 7: Navigating a Multi-Page Application

This directory is intended for your hands-on project for this level.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here using Vite.**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 7, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the setup. Remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` afterwards.

2.  **Install React Router:**
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    # or
    # yarn add react-router-dom
    ```
    You may also want `@types/react-router-dom` if they are not included by default, though often they are sufficient.

3.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-07-routing` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "Multi-Page Blog Frontend"
    *   Evaluation Criteria

4.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`.
    *   Create a `pages/` or `views/` directory for your page components (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`, `PostPage.tsx`, `AboutPage.tsx`).
    *   Set up your routing in `App.tsx` or a dedicated routing configuration file.
    *   Create a `components/` directory for shared components like a `Navbar.tsx`.

Good luck!
