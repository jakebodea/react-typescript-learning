# Project Starter for Level 3: Styling Components and Mastering Forms

This directory is intended for your hands-on project for this level.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here using Vite.**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 3, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the setup. Remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` afterwards.
    If you plan to use Tailwind CSS, follow its installation guide for Vite projects.
    If you plan to use Styled Components, you'll need to add it (`npm install styled-components @types/styled-components` or `yarn add styled-components @types/styled-components`).

2.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-03-styling-forms` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "User Registration Form with Validation"
    *   Evaluation Criteria

3.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`. Focus on styling and form handling with validation.
    You will likely create a `RegistrationForm.tsx` component and associated styling files or styled component definitions.

Good luck!
