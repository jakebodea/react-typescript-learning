# Project Starter for Level 5: Creating Reusable Logic and Flexible Components

This directory is intended for your hands-on project for this level.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here using Vite.**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 5, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the setup. Remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` afterwards.

2.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-05-custom-hooks-advanced-props` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "Generic Data Table and `useToggle` Hook"
    *   Evaluation Criteria (including testing suggestions with Jest & RTL - you'll need to set these up if you tackle the tests: `npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event` or yarn equivalents).

3.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`.
    *   Create a `hooks/` directory for your `useToggle.ts` (or `.tsx`) custom hook.
    *   Create a `components/` directory for your generic `DataTable.tsx` component.
    *   Demonstrate their usage in `App.tsx` or other components.

Good luck!
