# Project Starter for Level 2: Building with Components and Handling User Interactions

This directory is intended for your hands-on project for this level.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here using Vite.**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 2, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the setup. Remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` afterwards.

2.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-02-component-composition` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "Interactive To-Do List"
    *   Evaluation Criteria

3.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`. Focus on component composition and event handling.
    You will need to create components like `TodoForm.tsx`, `TodoList.tsx`, and `TodoItem.tsx` within your `src` directory.

Good luck!
