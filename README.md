# React with TypeScript: A 10-Level Learning Journey

Welcome to the React with TypeScript 10-Level Learning Journey!

This directory structure contains a comprehensive learning sequence designed to help a developer improve their skills in React with TypeScript, progressing from beginner to advanced.

## Structure

Each `level-XX-<topic>` directory corresponds to a specific level in the learning path and contains:

*   `instructions.md`: This file details:
    *   Level Title
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   A Hands-on Project or Exercises description
    *   Evaluation Criteria for the project

*   `project_starter/`: This directory is where you should initialize and build the hands-on project for the level.
    *   `README.md`: Contains initial instructions on how to set up your React + TypeScript project within this folder (e.g., using Create React App or Vite).

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the directory for the level you are working on (e.g., `cd level-01-intro-react-typescript`).
2.  Read the `instructions.md` file carefully to understand the goals and the project for that level.
3.  Navigate into the `project_starter` subdirectory (`cd project_starter`).
4.  Initialize your React + TypeScript project there, as guided by the `project_starter/README.md`.
5.  Implement the project, focusing on the key topics and objectives for that level.
6.  Use the evaluation criteria in `instructions.md` to test your project.
