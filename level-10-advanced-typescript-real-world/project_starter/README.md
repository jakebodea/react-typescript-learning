# Project Starter for Level 10: Mastering Advanced TypeScript and Building a Cohesive Application

This directory is intended for your capstone project for this learning path.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here using Vite.**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 10, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```
    Follow the prompts to complete the setup. Remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` afterwards.

2.  **Install necessary libraries based on your chosen implementations from previous levels:**
    *   **State Management (choose one, from Level 6):**
        *   Zustand: `npm install zustand` (or yarn)
        *   Redux Toolkit: `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux` (or yarn)
    *   **Routing (from Level 7):**
        *   `npm install react-router-dom` (or yarn)
    *   **(Optional) API client:**
        *   `npm install axios` (or yarn)
    *   **(Optional) Validation library (e.g., Zod):**
        *   `npm install zod` (or yarn)

3.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-10-advanced-typescript-real-world` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "Mini E-commerce Dashboard"
    *   Evaluation Criteria and Code Review Focus.

4.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`.
    *   This is a culmination project. Focus on integrating concepts from all previous levels.
    *   Pay close attention to robust TypeScript usage, project structure, and error handling.
    *   Structure your project thoughtfully (e.g., `src/features/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/pages/`, `src/types/`, `src/store/`, `src/lib/`).

This is your chance to build a more complex application and solidify your learning. Good luck!
