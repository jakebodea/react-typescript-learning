# Level 10: Advanced TypeScript Patterns & Real-World Project Integration

*   **Level Title:** Mastering Advanced TypeScript and Building a Cohesive Application
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Apply advanced TypeScript patterns for highly robust and scalable React applications.
    *   Integrate various concepts learned throughout the levels into a more complex, cohesive project.
    *   Understand strategies for typing API interactions and handling errors gracefully.
*   **Key Topics/Concepts Covered:**
    *   Advanced Utility Types: `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, `ReturnType`, `Parameters`.
    *   Mapped Types: e.g., making all properties of a type optional or readonly.
    *   Conditional Types (more in-depth).
    *   Type Guards (user-defined type guards, `in` operator, `typeof`).
    *   Discriminated Unions for state machines or variant component props.
    *   Typing API responses/requests robustly (e.g., using interfaces/types for request bodies and response data).
    *   Global error handling strategies (e.g., Error Boundaries, interceptors for API calls).
    *   Project structuring for larger applications (e.g., feature-first vs. type-first).
    *   (Optional) Introduction to integrating with external libraries or tools like `zod` for runtime validation that complements TypeScript.
*   **Hands-on Project: "Mini E-commerce Dashboard"**
    *   **Description:** Build a more comprehensive frontend application that brings together many of the concepts learned. This could be a dashboard for managing products in an e-commerce system.
    *   **Features:**
        1.  **Authentication (Mocked):** A simple login/logout flow (can be faked with `localStorage` and context).
        2.  **Dashboard Page (Protected Route):**
            *   Display a list of products (fetched from a mock API or static JSON, typed).
            *   Ability to add a new product via a form (with advanced validation and typed state).
            *   Ability to edit an existing product (pre-filling the form).
            *   Ability to delete a product.
        3.  Use the state management solution from Level 6 (Zustand/RTK) for managing products and potentially auth state.
        4.  Use React Router for navigation between login, dashboard, add product, edit product pages.
        5.  Apply advanced TypeScript types for product data, form states, API interactions.
        6.  Implement at least one Error Boundary to catch rendering errors in a part of the UI.
        7.  Structure the project well (e.g., `features/products`, `features/auth`, `components/common`, `hooks`, `types`).
    *   **Challenge:** Ensure maximum type safety across the application. Use advanced utility types or mapped types where they make sense to reduce boilerplate or improve clarity.
*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   **Expected Output:** A functional mini-dashboard with authentication, product CRUD operations, and robust typing.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**
        *   **TypeScript Usage:** Correct and advanced use of TypeScript. Are types precise? Are utility types, mapped types, or conditional types used effectively? Are API interactions typed?
        *   **Component Design & State Management:** Are components well-designed? Is state managed logically (local vs. global)?
        *   **Routing & Navigation:** Is routing set up correctly? Are protected routes implemented?
        *   **Error Handling:** Is there evidence of error handling (e.g., for API calls, Error Boundaries)?
        *   **Project Structure:** Is the project organized in a scalable manner?
        *   **Testing:** (Stretch goal for this level, but good to consider) Are there some key tests?
    *   **Manual Testing Steps:**
        1.  Attempt to access dashboard without login; should redirect to login.
        2.  Login. Verify access to dashboard.
        3.  View product list.
        4.  Add a new product with valid data. Verify it appears in the list.
        5.  Attempt to add a product with invalid data. Verify validation messages.
        6.  Edit an existing product. Verify changes are saved and reflected.
        7.  Delete a product. Verify it's removed from the list.
        8.  Logout. Verify redirection to login and loss of access to dashboard.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The application implements mock authentication and protected routes.
        *   CRUD operations for products are functional.
        *   Advanced TypeScript features (e.g., utility types, discriminated unions for form/API states) are used appropriately and improve code quality.
        *   API interaction types (request/response) are clearly defined.
        *   An Error Boundary is implemented for at least one section of the application.
        *   The project is well-structured and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of building modern React applications with TypeScript.
