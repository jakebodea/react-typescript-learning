# Project Starter for Level 1: Getting Started with React and TypeScript

This directory is intended for your hands-on project for this level.

## Instructions:

1.  **Set up your React + TypeScript project here.**
    You can use Create React App:
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 1, then run:
    npx create-react-app . --template typescript
    ```
    Alternatively, use Vite (recommended for faster setup):
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the 'project_starter' directory for Level 1, then run:
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
    # or
    # yarn create vite . --template react-ts
    ```

2.  **Refer to `../instructions.md`** (the file in the `level-01-intro-react-typescript` directory) for:
    *   Learning Objectives
    *   Key Topics/Concepts Covered
    *   Detailed Project Description and Features for the "Simple Greeting Card Maker"
    *   Evaluation Criteria

3.  **Implement the project** described in `../instructions.md`. Focus on applying the concepts learned in this level.
    You will need to create the necessary file structure (e.g., `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/GreetingCard.tsx`, etc.) based on the project requirements.

Good luck!
